# Merrow :mermaid:

Like a mermaid, but more terrifying.

Merrow is a stylish 3D flowchart viewer that parses mermaid graphs and presents them interactively in three.js.

## Motivation

Flowcharts are a fantastic visual medium for ideation and communication.

Mermaid flowcharts are a fantastic way to easy make git-friendly and maintainable flowcharts.

Mermaid (and Graphviz) provides a great experience for small to medium graphs, but its usefulness quickly reaches a limit.

As a flowchart's complexity increases, 2D layout engines start breaking down, or producing visuals incomprehensible to mere mortals.

In 3D, we trade that problem in for new ones, but we have one more dimension for our complexity to spill into!

This work is experimental and ongoing.

## Usage

Simply run:

```
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Modify `src/mermaid-flowchart.md` to see the visualization change.
